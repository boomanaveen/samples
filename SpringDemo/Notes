Applicationcontext reads the spring xml and initilizes and creates springbean 
--This happens when application context is initilized 
and when get bean happens, the applicationcontext hands over the created springbean..

Basic Basic Spring Scope
========================
1. Singleton - Only once per spring container (Only one instance per spring container..) - DEFAULT
-It initializes all the bean during the initilization of the context itself

2. Prototype - New bean created with every request or reference (New obj are created every time during getBean or even during ref)
- It initializes during getBean, because it creates new instances everytime

3.Web-aware - Scopes
A. Request - A new bean is created per servlet request
B. Session - A new bean per session, as long as one user is accessing per session and if its a new user and new session, then new bean is created
C. Global Session - New bean per Global HTTP session (Portlet Context)
